## Summary

We use a random forest classifier and logistic regression model to predict a person's fear of earthquakes based on their demographic information. Both models were able to predict subjects' fear of earthquakes only slightly better than a dummy classifier. This indicates that there is potential for predictions based on demographics. However, our data set was small and included only four demographic features, which limited the models' predictive ability to slightly better than random guessing. More data that contains more demographic information could lead to better prediction results.

## Introduction

The damage that earthquakes cause can leave people without food, water, and shelter. Being prepared for an earthquake before it happens can make living through the immediate aftermath less traumatic (@72124acf2fa84e8aad36e68d0dc4c5e6). Having insurance that covers the damage caused by earthquakes may reduce the uncertainty and fear that the threat of earthquakes creates. People who are afraid of earthquakes represent a group of potential clients for companies selling earthquake preparedness products and insurance. It has been demonstrated that people who are more concerned about earthquakes are more likely to have taken preparatory measures, such as owning a preparedness kit [@doi.org/10.1111/j.1559-1816.1992.tb00984.x].

We aim to predict whether a US resident is afraid of earthquakes and to identify which demographic features contribute to the prediction. This information could be used to identify target demographics for advertising. This would enable earthquake-related companies to build a marketing strategy based on this information to reach potential customers and increase revenue.

## Methods

## Data

The data for this analysis was downloaded from <https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/san-andreas>. It is based on a survey conducted by [fivethirtyeight.com](https://fivethirtyeight.com/) in May 2015, of 1014 respondents in the US.

The data set contains

-   demographic information (age, gender, household income, region of residence in the United States),

-   responses to survey questions relating to knowledge of and experience with earthquakes,

-   self-reported level of fear of earthquakes.

The responses to the survey questions would likely have been very predictive of fear of earthquakes, but advertisers would not have access to this information conducting a similar survey of their own. This would likely be very expensive so we limited our analysis to the demographic information, which is publicly available through US census data.

Some preliminary examination of the data shows some relation between the demographic features and earthquake fear.

```{r feature_distributions, fig.align = 'center', out.width = "80%", fig.cap = "Fig 1: Distribution of demographic information among survey respondents"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("visuals", "feature_distributions.png"))
```

The survey respondents were fairly evenly split across ages categories and genders. The household income distribution was not uniform, but is likely a reflection of the US population's income distribution, that had a median value of $55,775 in 2015 [@bureau_2018]. The distribution across US regions was not uniform, possibly due to the fact that the list of regions is divided into geographic regions that don't necessarily have the same populations. For example, the Pacific region (Washington, Oregon, and California) has a population of 50.1 million compared to New England (Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont) has a combined population of 14.7 million [@bureau_2019].

```{r feature_distributions_across_response, fig.align = 'center', out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "Fig 2: The level of earthquake fear across demograhic features"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("visuals", "feature_distributions_across_response.png"))
```

Younger people tend to report being afraid more often than older people, while women report being afraid more often than men. The geographic region with the highest level of fear is the Pacific. Overall there were more people who were not afraid of earthquakes than were afraid.

```{r target_distribution, fig.align = 'center', out.width = "75%", fig.cap = "Fig 3: The distribution of earthquake fear among respondents"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("visuals", "target_distribution.png"))
```

## Analysis

We used a random forest classifier and a logistic regression for the classification task. In addition to binary classification for prediction, random forest classifier and logistic regression give a measure of importance for each feature. The prediction target is the self-reported fear of earthquakes, which we converted from an ordinal variable to a binary variable called `target`. The class `target` = 0 includes the levels *"not at all worried"* and *"not so worried"*, while `target` = 1 includes *"somewhat worried"*, *"very worried"*, and *"extremely worried"*. We computed SHAP values to investigate feature importance after some preliminary exploration of global feature importance.

## Results

Our models were a random forest classifier and a logistic regression which we compared to a dummy classifier that assigned a class randomly based on the target distribution. The models correctly predicted more positive outcomes and had fewer false positives than the dummy classifier .They also correctly predicted more negative outcomes than the dummy classifier.

This means the models could identify who was afraid of earthquakes better than picking at random, and who was not afraid of earthquakes better than picking at random. Incorrect predictions were lower than when picking at random.

```{r confusion_matrices, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", out.height="50%", fig.cap="Fig 4: Confusion matrix for each model used",fig.show='hold',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(c(here::here("visuals", "confusion_matrix_RandomForestClassifier.png"),
                          here::here("visuals", "confusion_matrix_LogisticRegression.png"),
                          here::here("visuals", "confusion_matrix_DummyClassifier.png")))
```

To capture the combined effects of precision and recall we scored our models' predictions using the F1 score. Both the random forest and logistic regression models had higher F1 scores than the dummy classifier.

```{r classifier_results_table, echo=FALSE, out.width="60%", out.height="60%", fig.cap="Fig 5: Classifier F1 scores",fig.show='hold',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("visuals", "classifier_results_table.png"))
```

Of the models positive predictions, a greater proportion were correct than the dummy classifier's, as characterized by our models' higher *ROC AUC* scores. The models predicted better than guessing at random, but not a by lot.

```{r roc_curves, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", out.height="50%", fig.cap="Fig 6: ROC curves for various models", fig.show='hold',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(c(here::here("visuals", "roc_auc_curve_RandomForestClassifier.png"),
                          here::here("visuals", "roc_auc_curve_LogisticRegression.png"),
                          here::here("visuals", "roc_auc_curve_DummyClassifier.png")))
```

We computed SHAP values to see the degree to which each feature contributed to a positive prediction. The feature for both that was most important in both models for being afraid of earthquakes was living in the Pacific region. This is not surprising since that region experiences more earthquakes than any other region.

Both models predicted that living in the East North Central region was predictive of lower levels of fear. These results indicate that geographic region plays a big role in predicted fear levels.

```{r feature importance, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", out.height="50%", fig.cap="Fig 7: SHAP plot for random forest and logistic regression classifiers",fig.show='hold',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(c(here::here("visuals", "shap_summary_plot_RandomForestClassifier.png"),
                          here::here("visuals", "shap_summary_plot_LogisticRegression.png")))
```

The next feature that both models identified as predictive of a positive fear response was age, with younger people showing more fear than older people. Looking at the two variables for gender, our model predicts women are more likely to be afraid of earthquakes than men.

With the data that we have, our models were not effective in identifying people who are afraid of earthquakes with a high degree of certainty. However, because our data set had only four features, we believe there is potential for improved predictions if we had a more comprehensive data set. This would require collecting more information in the form of a larger survey.
